<h1 align="center" > Python-Projects </h1>

If I could give my former self one piece of advice when I was struggling to learn Python as a beginner, it would be this: **create more Python projects.**

### 1. Bike Rental System: 

A bike rental or bike hire business rents out bicycles for short periods of time, usually for a few hours. Most rentals are provided by bike shops as a sideline to their main businesses of sales and service, but shops specialize in rentals.

**License:** This code is open source. So feel free to use, modify, share, download as per your need. I do not take risk nor responsibility for your errors or any commercial damage.

**How to run?** This code is written in python3.6.

Simply run

      python main.py
      # or depending upon your config
      python3 main.py

### 2. Create Acronyms: 

**Approach :** The following steps are required:

- Take input as a string.
- Add the first letter of string to output.
- Iterate over the full string and add every next letter to space to output.
- Change the output to uppercase(required acronym).

### 3. E-mail Slicer: 

Email Slicer is nothing but just a tool which will take an email id as an input and will perform slicing operations on it to return the username and the domain of the email id.

    Example:
    Input: rishabh.singh@gmail.com
    Output: Your username is rishabh.singh & domain is gmail.com

### 4. Story Generator:

**Now, the pertinent question is - How we will do so? Its answer is very simple :**

- We will first put the elements of the story in different lists.
- Then we will use the random module to select random parts of the story collected in different lists.
- And then concatenate them to make a story.

We will make use of 'random.choice()' function. Before starting, let's see an example of how 'random.choice()' works.

### 5. Alarm Clock:-

<b> How to Create an Alarm Clock with Python? </b>

As the title suggests, our task here is to write a python script that creates an alarm clock. For this task, I will be using the DateTime module in Python to create an alarm clock and the sound library in Python to play the alarm sound.

The DateTime module comes preinstalled in the Python programming language so you can easily import it in your program. The playsound library can be easily installed by using a pip command; pip install playsound. I hope you will be able to install it in your systems, now let’s see how to write a program to create an alarm with Python.

**Summary:** I hope you liked this article on how to write a program to create an alarm with Python. Feel free to ask your valuable questions in the comments section below.

### 6. Rock, Paper and Scissors Game 

To create the Rock, Paper and Scissors game with Python, we need to take the user’s choice and then we need to compare it with the computer choice which is taken using the random module in Python from a list of choices, and if the user wins then the score will increase by 1:

Creating these types of games will help a beginner to think logically. You can even use this idea to make your own game. In the end, creating these types of programs will help you create your algorithms, which is a very important skill for coding interviews and competitive programming.

### 7. Dice Roll Simulator with Python

To simulate a dice roll with Python, I’ll be using the random module in Python. The random module can be imported easily into your code as it is preinstalled in the Python programming language. 

After importing the random module, you have access to all the functions included in the module. It’s a pretty long list, but for our purposes, we’ll use the random.randint() function. This function returns a random integer based on the start and end we specify.

The smallest value of a dice roll is 1 and the largest is 6, this logic can be used to simulate a dice roll. This gives us the start and end values to use in our random.randint() function. Now let’s see how to simulate a dice roll with Python:

### 8. QR Codes with Python: Tutorial

In this section, I will take you through a tutorial on how to generate QR codes with Python. To generate QR Codes with Python you need to install only one Python library for this task:

- pip install pyqrcode
Now let’s see how to create a QR Code with Python programming language:

### 9. Print Colored Text with Python

Traditionally, printing full-colour text to the terminal is accomplished by a series of escape characters on Linux or OS X systems. However, this will not work for Windows operating systems. Now let’s see how to print coloured text with Python using the Colorama module:

### 10. BMI Calculator with Python

The body mass index is calculated by dividing an individual’s weight in kilograms by their height in meters, then dividing the answer again by their height. Now let’s see how to create a BMI calculator with Python:
